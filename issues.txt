=====CURRENT ISSUES WITH AUTOLEMMA.PY======

ENCLITICS:
    Currently program does not recognize enclitics (-que, -ne, etc.) on
      input words.

    EXAMPLE:
        INPUT       puellaeque
        EXPECTED    processed as two words,  "puellae" and "que"
        ACTUAL      processed as one word, "puellaeque", which isn't in dataset.

    Possible fix:
        Check if input word ends in enclitic ending.
        If it does, check also that it itsn't a word which looks like it has
          an enclitic ending, but doesn't (e.g., "quisque", "ratione", etc.).
            (This would just be a lookup table.)

LINE NUMBERING:
    Currently the program detects "blank lines" by checking how many words
      are in a line.  If there are fewer than 3 words, the line is not given
      a number.
    This may not work for some latin verse, which can have <3 word lines.

    Possible fix:
        Require that all extranneous lines be removed from text before it is 
          given to autoLemma.py

UGLY SPAGHETTI CODE:
    Need to add some more comments -- look for "TODO"s in code.
    No longer need xlsx input functionality.
    The makeNewWorkbook() method, or whatever it's called, has gotten bloated.
        (I think I pointed this out in the code)


=============FUTURE FEATURES==============

GUI FRONTEND
    Make a nice little GUI for autoLemma.py!
